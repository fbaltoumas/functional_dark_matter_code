# functional_dark_matter_code


This repository contains script used for the manipulation of sequence alignments, preparation for 3D modeling and mass-scale 3D structure search of PDB models against reference datasets (e.g. PDB, SCOP) with TMalign/MMalign.

The aforementioned code was used in Pavlopoulos et al (2023), Unraveling the functional dark matter through global metagenomics. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-0000-0
